    <p>My name is Juliana Alikutepa.I graduated with a degree in Environmental Science. However, there was a particular module in my course , Geographic Information System, GIS, that drew me closer to computers and awakened in me the urge to study programming. Currently, I am a <span>Full stack Web Developer,</span> with the ability to write well designed, testable, efficient code by using best software development practices. I can create website layouts by using HTML and CSS. Among my other abilities is gathering  and refining specifications and requirements based on technical needs. I am able to cooperate with other web designers and I am always plugged into emerging technologies with ability to apply them into operations. Whenever I am not infront of a screen, I'm either baking or taking a nature walk.</p>

        <p>In my programming journey, I have also teamed up with other programmers to come up with website designs. It is worth noting that I was the scrum master of <a href="https://brian-makau.github.io/TREE-DOM_254/">this</a> particular project. We used HTML, CSS and some bit of JS.</p>
